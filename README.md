# ML-Sound-Binary-Classification

This repository contains all the code written for a Kaggle competition held by my University for the students in my year. I finished on the 5th place out of 136 students.

It was an audio binary classification task, where participants had to discriminate between uterances with and without surgical masks.

Brief description of my approach: I extracted a 2d-shaped melspectrogram from each audio file and then used a Convolutional Neural Network (using PyTorch) to classify the 2d-shaped arrays.

A very detailed documentation of the project can be found in the `Project Documentation.pdf` file.
